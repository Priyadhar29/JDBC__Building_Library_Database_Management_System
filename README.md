# JDBC Building Library Database Management System 📚⚙️

## Project Overview
This project is a **Library Database Management System** built using **Java JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**. It provides comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage library data including books, authors, members, and categories. The system enables efficient handling of library resources with a well-structured relational database schema. 📖✨

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and view books. 📕➕✏️🗑️👀
- **Author Management**: Maintain author information linked to books. ✍️📝🧑‍🎨
- **Member Management**: Register, update, and remove members. 👥🆕🔄🚫
- **Category Management**: Categorize books for better organization. 🗂️📂🏷️
- **Relational Integrity**: Enforced with foreign keys for consistent data. 🔗✅
- **JDBC Implementation**: Robust usage of `PreparedStatement` and `Statement` for secure and efficient database operations. 💻🔒⚡

## Technologies Used
- Java SE (Standard Edition) ☕🖥️
- JDBC API for database interaction 🛠️📡
- MySQL (or any compatible relational database) 🐬💾
- SQL for schema and data manipulation 🗃️🧮

## Database Schema
The project uses the following core tables:

- `Books`  
  Columns: `book_id`, `title`, `author_id`, `published_year`, `genre`, `available`, `category_id` 📚📘🆔

- `Authors`  
  Columns: `author_id`, `name`, `bio` ✍️📜👨‍🏫

- `Members`  
  Columns: `member_id`, `name`, `email`, `join_date` 👥📧📆

- `Categories`  
  Columns: `category_id`, `category_name` 🗂️🏷️📋

Refer to the SQL schema files for complete table creation scripts and sample data. 📝📊

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install MySQL** (or your preferred RDBMS) and create a new database named `LibraryManagementDB`. 🐬🛠️

2. **Run the SQL scripts** provided to create tables and insert sample data into your database. 📥🗄️

3. **Configure the JDBC connection** in your Java application:
   - Update the database URL, username, and password in your connection setup code. 🔧🔐

4. **Compile and run** the Java application. ▶️⚙️

## Usage

- The system allows performing CRUD operations through the Java console or UI (if implemented). 🎛️👨‍💻
- Utilize the provided DAO (Data Access Object) classes implementing JDBC code with `PreparedStatement` for safe queries. 🛡️🔐
- Demonstrations include:
  - Adding new books and authors ➕📚✍️
  - Registering new library members 🆕👤
  - Querying books, authors, and members 🔍📑
  - Updating and deleting records as necessary 🔄🗑️

## Best Practices Employed

- Use of **PreparedStatements** to prevent SQL injection attacks. 🛡️🦠🔒
- Proper resource management with try-with-resources blocks to close connections, statements, and result sets. 🧹🛠️
- Referential integrity through foreign keys. 🔗✅
- Clear separation of database operations for maintainability. 🧩📐

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-based front end. 🖥️🖱️
- Implement user authentication and roles. 🔑👥🛂
- Support for book reservations and fines. 📅🔖💰
- Real-time notifications and reporting features. 🔔📊📈
